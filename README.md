Hi! I am Ahyoung (Anna), a recent graduate with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from UCLA. Throughout my university years, I realized that data has the potential to make a meaningful difference in peopleâ€™s lives. This realization has driven me to pursue a career where I can combine my passion for helping others with my analytical skills. During my academic projects, I loved collaborating with others to improve outcomes and solve complex problems. Now, I am excited to bring this same sense of purpose and teamwork to a professional setting, where we can make a positive change together.
